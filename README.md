# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The information provided within these files was compiled in order to draw parallels between the crowdfunded play titled Fever and other plays which were able to be preformed through crowdfunding donations. 
### Purpose
Fever found success with their crowdfunding through Kickstarter in a relatively short span of time, and Louise, the play’s organizer required data which could verify if the donation success Fever had was common to other theater productions. 
The analysis done for Louise focuses on comparing the success or failures relative to the time of year the crowdfunding starts, as well as comparing success, failure, and cancelation of the project relative to the financial requirements for the production to be launched.

## Analysis and Challenges
This assignment seemed very straight forward after having had all the hands-on work that the modules provided.     
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The one instance where I had to pause to consider a way forward was when the assignment required us to make COUNTIFS formulas in Excel. It was a new formula, but the hint in the assignment provided a great example on how to model my own formula. Carefully putting it together in Notepad before applying it to Excel yielded a functional formula on my first attempt. A screenshot of the hint is included to show where I focused in order to gain an understanding of this formula.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
If studying the outcomes based on the launch date of the Kickstarter, we can clearly see that there is a high level of success when the crowdfunding is launched in June. A second point to raise about this part of the analysis relates to the numbers we see in December. It is the month with the lowest success rate, but it also sees an almost equal number of failed attempts compared to successes. That suggests that there is nearly a 50% chance that a theatre production will be unable to gather the funds required to put a play on a stage.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
When assessing the outcomes based on the size of a production’s financial goals, we can tell that the chance of failure rises the higher the monetary amount needed to produce the play. There is however an interested decrease in the failure rates for crowdfunding campaigns between $35,000 and 45,000. 
If we look at the data on plays that are successful with their fundraising goal it suggests that less costly productions often meet their donation goals in order to go into production. The greater the fundraising goals, the less potential the organizers have in meeting those goals. In this instance there is again an interesting deviation from the trend at the $35,000 to $45,000 range. Plays that have that funding requirement seem to be well positioned to meet their goals.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation is that we cannot know with this analysis how close a production got to their crowdfunding targets. A failed attempt may have only been a dollar away from what they asked for, and though their crowdfunding data shows they failed the show may still have been able to go on. Another thing to consider is canceled crowdfunding attempts. It may be that the play was canceled for other reasons, and they didn’t require the funding. But it may also have been that they saw they were not accumulating donations within the required time frame, and as a result the organizers may have canceled the Kickstarter. To some that may still be considered a failure. Alternatively, the organizers may have found financial success through other channels in order to put together their play. That sort of information could be helpful for other theatre organizers who need to finance their plays, even if it doesn’t directly relate to crowdfunding. This data set of a success/fail scenario doesn’t tell a very in-depth story.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
If the analysis was done a second time, charting the actual donation totals of crowdfunding campaigns over time might help organizers to better understand what to expect from Kickstarter donations. Knowing how often success is met with the bare requirements, or how badly the failures fare in their attempts could be helpful for the planners of future plays. Another factor to consider is the length of time that the organizers give to crowdfunding campaigns. If the donations are allowed to accumulate over a long span are they more likely to meet their targets, or does interest drop off if the Kickstarter runs for too long? These could be helpful for organizers to know.
